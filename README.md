- **No Build Process**: No compilation, bundling, or transpilation required
- **Zero Server Dependencies**: Runs entirely client-side with no backend
- **Modern Web Standards**: Built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5

### Dependencies (CDN)

All dependencies are loaded from CDN‚Äîno package manager required:

- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) (v6.6.2): Fuzzy search functionality
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) (v9.1.6): Markdown parsing and rendering
- [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) (v3.10.1): Client-side ZIP file processing
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (v6.5.2): Icon library

### Key Components

- **Conversation Normalization**: Detects and normalizes ChatGPT and Claude conversation formats into a unified schema
- **Search Engine**: Configurable fuzzy search with title-only or full-content modes using Fuse.js
- **Markdown Renderer**: Secure HTML sanitization with code block enhancement and syntax highlighting
- **Export Engine**: Generates formatted Markdown files with metadata and proper escaping
- **State Management**: localStorage-based preference and state persistence
- **Tool Block Rendering**: Specialized rendering for tool/function calls and results

### Data Format

Conversations are normalized to a unified structure:

```javascript
{
  id: string,                    // Unique conversation identifier
  provider: 'chatgpt' | 'claude', // Source provider
  title: string,                 // Conversation title
  created: timestamp,            // Creation timestamp
  updated: timestamp,            // Last update timestamp
  sourceFileName: string,        // Original source file name
  metadata: {                    // Provider-specific metadata
    conversationId: string,      // ChatGPT conversation ID
    uuid: string                 // Claude conversation UUID
  },
  messages: [
    {
      id: string,                // Message identifier
      role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system' | 'tool',
      text: string,              // Plain text content
      textSegments: [            // Structured segments for rendering
        {
          type: 'text' | 'code' | 'tool',
          text: string,
          markdown: string,      // Markdown-formatted content
          language: string,      // Code block language
          toolName: string       // Tool/function name
        }
      ],
      timestamp: timestamp       // Message timestamp
    }
  ]
}
```

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All operations execute in your browser's JavaScript runtime
- **No Network Requests**: After loading CDN libraries, operates entirely offline
- **HTML Sanitization**: User content is sanitized before rendering to prevent XSS attacks
- **No Analytics**: No tracking, telemetry, or analytics of any kind
- **No Data Persistence**: Conversations are loaded into memory and cleared on page reload
- **Minimal localStorage**: Only UI preferences are stored locally (dark mode, search state, etc.)
- **No Cookies**: Application does not use cookies

### What Gets Stored

The application stores only these preferences in localStorage:

- `ucs.pref.darkMode`: Dark mode toggle state
- `ucs.pref.markdown`: Markdown rendering toggle state
- `ucs.pref.language`: UI language preference
- `ucs.pref.rememberScroll`: Scroll position preference
- `ucs.pref.sidebarCollapse`: Sidebar collapse state
- `ucs.state.searchQuery`: Last search query
- `ucs.state.searchScopes`: Search scope preferences

**Conversation data is never persisted to disk by the application.**

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working in:

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based browsers)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari

Requires modern JavaScript features:

- ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals)
- Async/await
- LocalStorage API
- File API
- Blob API
- crypto.randomUUID (with fallback)

## Project Structure

```bash
unified-chat-search/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Complete application (single file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                # MIT License
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

**Optional data directory** (git-ignored):

```bash
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatgpt-export/       # Your ChatGPT exports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-export/        # Your Claude exports
```

## Development

The application is intentionally built as a single HTML file for maximum portability and simplicity.

### Modifying the Application

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred editor
2. The file contains three main sections:
   - **Styles** (lines ~15-1500): CSS variables, component styles, animations
   - **Markup** (lines ~1500-1780): HTML structure and layout
   - **Scripts** (lines ~1780-4790): Application logic and functionality
3. External dependencies are loaded from CDN‚Äîno package manager required
4. Test changes by refreshing the page in your browser

### Code Organization

The JavaScript is organized into logical sections:

- **Constants & Configuration**: Provider definitions, storage keys, UI translations
- **Element References**: DOM element caching for performance
- **State Management**: Application state object and persistence
- **Initialization**: Setup, event binding, preference restoration
- **File Processing**: ZIP handling, JSON parsing, format detection, normalization
- **UI Rendering**: Conversation list, message display, metadata rendering
- **Search**: Fuzzy search implementation with Fuse.js
- **Export**: Markdown generation and file downloads
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for formatting, sanitization, and DOM manipulation

### Making Contributions

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/improvement`)
3. Make your changes to `index.html`
4. Test thoroughly in multiple browsers
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add improvement'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/improvement`)
7. Create a Pull Request

**Guidelines:**

- Maintain the single-file architecture
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Ensure privacy-first design principles are maintained
- Document any new features in the README

2. Search for existing issues or create a new one
3. Provide details about your browser, OS, and the issue

## FAQ

**Q: Is my conversation data sent to any server?**
A: No. All processing happens locally in your browser. The application only loads external libraries from CDN on first use.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: After the first load (which fetches CDN libraries), you can save the page and use it offline.

**Q: What happens to my conversation data?**
A: Conversation data is loaded into browser memory and cleared when you close/reload the page. It is never saved or transmitted.

**Q: Which file should I load from my ChatGPT export?**
A: You can load either the entire ZIP file or just the `conversations.json` file from the extracted archive.

**Q: Why is the application a single HTML file?**
A: For maximum portability, simplicity, and privacy. You can audit the entire codebase in one file and run it anywhere.

**Q: Can I customize the styling?**
A: Yes. The CSS is in the `<style>` section at the top of `index.html`. Modify CSS variables in `:root` for global changes.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**
A: The UI is responsive and works on mobile browsers, though the experience is optimized for desktop.
